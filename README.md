Calculator App â€“ Manual Testing Project (Excel-based)
# Description:
This project showcases a manual testing approach for a basic Calculator Mobile/Desktop Application, documented in an Excel sheet. It includes a variety of functional test cases for core calculator features like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and handling of edge cases such as divide-by-zero and input limits.

The test cases were executed manually, and results were recorded with Pass/Fail statuses based on the actual output versus the expected output. This project is ideal for demonstrating practical manual QA testing skills including:

Test Case Writing

Test Execution

Bug Identification

Result Analysis

Real-world Application Testing

# Key Features Tested:
Basic Arithmetic Operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)

Handling of Invalid Inputs (e.g., divide by zero)

Decimal and Negative Number Support

Input Length Limits

Operator Precedence (BODMAS)

UI Actions like Clear Entry (C)

# Tools Used:
Excel (for documentation)

Android/iOS Calculator App (for execution)

Manual testing techniques
